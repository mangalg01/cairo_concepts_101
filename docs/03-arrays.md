`Span` is a struct that represents a snapshot of an **Array**. It is designed to provide safe and controlled access to the elements of an array without modifying the originial array. Span is particularly useful for ensuring data integrity and avoiding borrowing issues when passing arrays between functions or when performing read-only operations.
